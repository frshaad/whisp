## Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frshaad/whisp.git
cd whisp
```

```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in both the `client` and `api` directories. Hereâ€™s an example:
